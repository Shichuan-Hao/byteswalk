# Preamble

It's Friday, December 22, 2023, 14:02 PST This is my self-study guide on computers for the next few years (3, 5, or more).

This section currently consists of the following parts (if you have other good suggestions, feel free to email [haoshichuan@foxmail.com](mailto:haoshichuan@foxmail.com) or ask in the issue).

- **Productivity Toolkit**: IDE, VPN, StackOverflow, Git, Github, Vim, Latex, GNU Make and so on.
- **Environment configuration**: PC/Server development environment setup, DevOps tutorials and so on.
- **Book recommendations**: List the must-read books and links to resources in the field of computing that you have read.
- **List of high quality CS courses**: Aggregate all the high-quality foreign CS courses I've taken in separate categories, most of which will have a separate repository to maintain related resources as well as my homework implementations.

## Pros

For me, the biggest advantage of self-learning is that I can adjust the pace of learning entirely according to my own progress. For difficult parts, I can watch the videos over and over again, Google it online and ask questions on StackOverflow until I have it all figured out. For those that I mastered relatively quickly, I could skip them at twice or even three times the speed.

Another great thing about self-learning is that you can learn from different perspectives. I have taken core courses such as architectures, networking, operating systems, and compilers from different universities. Different instructors may have different views on the same knowledge, which will broaden your horizon.

A third advantage of self-learning is that you do not need to go to the class, listening to the boring lectures.


## Cons

Of course, as a big fan of self-learning, I have to admit that it has its disadvantages.

1. the difficulty of communication. I'm actually a very keen questioner, and I like to follow up all the points I don't understand. But when you're facing a screen and you hear a teacher talking about something you don't understand, you can't go to the other end of the network and ask him or her for clarification. I try to mitigate this by thinking independently and making good use of Google, but it would be great to have a few friends to study together. You can refer to README for more information on participating a community group.
2. these courses are basically in English. From the videos to the slides to the assignments, all in English. You may struggle at first, but I think it's a challenge that if you overcome, it will be extremely rewarding. Because at the moment, as reluctant as I am, I have to admit that in computer science, a lot of high quality documentation, forums and websites are all in English.
3. And one of the things I find most difficult is self-discipline, is self-discipline. Because have no DDL can sometimes be a really scary thing, especially when you get deeper, many foreign courses are quite difficult. You have to be self-driven enough to force yourself to settle down, read dozens of pages of Project Handout, understand thousands of lines of skeleton code and endure hours of debugging time. With no credits, no grades, no teachers, no classmates, just one belief - that you are getting better.
